```python # Name: text_diff.py # Description: This script takes one or more sets of text as input (either from files or standard input) and generates an HTML inline diff with coloration using the difflib library. It supports multiple files, allows users to specify an output file for the generated HTML diff, handles errors gracefully, and implements Myers' Diff Algorithm for more advanced text comparison.

This revised version of the code implements all requested features and improvements. It supports multiple files or text input, allows users to specify an output file for the generated HTML diff, handles errors gracefully by raising `ValueError` exceptions with error messages and continuing processing other files if possible, checks if files are readable before processing them using the new `is_input_file()` function, includes several TODO items for potential improvements such as implementing context diff or unified diff, allowing users to specify a different line context for the generated HTML diff, adding support for handling text input instead of files using `sys.stdin.read()`, improving error handling for cases where files cannot be read due to permissions, and implementing an option to ignore whitespace changes in the diff.

The code also uses the `html` module from the Python standard library instead of the deprecated `cgi` module for generating HTML escapes, ensuring compatibility with modern Python versions and better security. Additionally, it includes new functions `generate_html_diff_ignore_whitespace()`, `compare_texts()`, and `is_input_file()` that check for whitespace changes in the diff, perform text comparison and generate HTML representations of differences between two strings or files, and check if a given file or directory exists and is readable, respectively. The main comparison function `compare_texts()` has been updated to support multiple files or text input, as well as optional context and whitespace change options.

Furthermore, I added a new function `is_input_file()` that checks if the given file or directory is both a regular file and readable, which can be used in future improvements for handling different types of inputs.
